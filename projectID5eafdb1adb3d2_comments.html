<HTML><BODY>In this book, Jean-Henri Fabre turns his attention to hunting wasps, about which we already have the follow-up volume in Project Gutenberg under the title <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462">More Hunting Wasps</a></i> for a very long time (since 2001).

<p>Again an easy to proofread work, so have fun!
